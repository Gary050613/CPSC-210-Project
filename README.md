# My Personal Project

## Project Background

This personal project will be a "Canvas like" application for teachers, TA's, and students to submit/ mark homeworks. 
The project will include structures like classes to indicate the grouping of students & TA's. It will also include different interfaces for different roles.

Students, TA's, and teachers will use this application.

I want to make this project as I work as a tutor, and the place that I work at still utilizes emails & Google Drive for students to submit their homeworks.
